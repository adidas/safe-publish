# Safe publish script

This scripts wraps `npm publish` to execute it in a safe way, without failing if the package already exists.

## Use cases

Avoid publication failing when a NPM package and version already exists.

It is useful to work along with [Lerna][lerna] to be able to manage the versions of each package independently.

## Requirements and dependencies

[NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/) are required to work with the repository.

## Installation and running

```
npm install safe-publish
```

```javascript
const cwd = process.cwd();
const { name, version } = require(join(cwd, 'package.json'));

publish({
  cwd,
  name,
  version
})
.catch((error) => {});
```

### Options

These values are required to be able to publish the package:

- `cwd` (string): working directory of the package to be published.
- `name` (string): name of the package to be published.
- `version` (string): version of the package to be published.

These values are optional and allow to configure the publication:

- `registry` (string): override the registry.
  - If the registry is not defined, NPM will use the default one.
  - The registry can be set in the `package.json`:
  ```
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://registry.url"
  }
  ```
- `force` (boolean): force the publication despite the fact that the package could exist.
  - It implies that the process could fail.
- `dry-run` (boolean): for testing purposes, it does not try to publish the package.
- `silent` (boolean): disable the log output.

### Command Line Interface

The script can be run via CLI:

```
safe-publish
safe-publish --registry=http://registry.url --silent
```

Options and aliases:

```
  --version       Show version number                                  [boolean]
  --help          Show help                                            [boolean]
  -r, --registry  Override default registry                             [string]
  -f, --force     Force publication                   [boolean] [default: false]
  -d, --dry-run   Test publication process            [boolean] [default: false]
  -s, --silent    Disable log output                  [boolean] [default: false]
```

## Example along with Lerna

Having a mono repository in which its package versions have to be managed in an independently way. We can use [Lerna][lerna] to run the `safe-publish` script:

- Root `package.json` with the running script:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "mono-repository",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "scripts": {
      "lerna:publish": "lerna exec -- safe-publish"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "lerna": "^2",
      "safe-publish": "^1"
    }
  }
  ```
- Package `package.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "package",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "files": [
      "dist",
      "README.md",
      "CHANGELOG.md"
    ]
  }
  ```
- Running NPM script:
  ```
  npm run lerna:publish -- --silent
  ```
